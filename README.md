Hello everyone! I'm Kuro, a BSIT student. My project is about lending money to a friend, but it can also be used as a system for starting a small lending business. It helps track who borrowed money, how much they owe, and allows for payment through ATM cards or digital wallets like GCash. I'd really appreciate it if you could give me honest feedback or suggestions on my flowchart. I know it might not be perfect, but I'm open to learning and would be very happy if you could help me improve it. Thank you!"
